hi! 
this is just a dump for all my dsa solutions that i'm practicing from [striver's a2z dsa sheet](https://takeuforward.org/dsa/strivers-a2z-sheet-learn-dsa-a-to-z) and also possible more random picks from the problem sets on leetcode whenever I can. 

the tears are real but im beginning to enjoy this </3
